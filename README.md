EchoBeat is a rhythm-based memory game where the player must recall and repeat increasingly complex sequences of sound tiles.  
As the sequence grows, so does the challenge. Test your memory across 3 different fun modes.  
Can you keep up with the beat?

## Modes
1. **Standard**: The player must repeat the sequence as it is.
2. **Odd One Out**: The game shows 2 similar sequences, the player must find the wrong tile that appears in the second one.
3. **Reverse**: Very similar to the standard one, but there is a twist: the player must repeat the sequences in reverse.

## Tips

Remember: each button can be used only 3 times during a game, use them wisely!

Use the [H] key to listen the selected tile's sound, arrows to select the game mode and that's it, have fun :)
